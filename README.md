# Engauge

## Summary

Engauge provides audience analytics for the presenter so that the presenter can dynamically change their presentation styles and increase engagement.

## Problem

An increasingly prevalent issue in today's virtual world is that presenters can't tell if their audience is paying attention virtually. When a presenter is sharing their screen, they cannot tell if their audience is engaged. We hope to make the presenter aware of the level of engagement in their audience.

## Solution

We can keep the presenter informed of the level of engagement in their audience through our project Engauge. Engauge provides the presenter with analytics regarding their audience over a period of ime in order to pinpoint when engagement drops off or picks up. A person is considered to be engaged if they are looking in the general direction of the camera lens, which indicates that they are paying attention. The analytics are shown in the form of a real-time updating line chart for the presenter.
